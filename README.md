libFLAC_litedyn
===================

It is free pascal bindings and wrapper around FLAC library. FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, an audio format similar to MP3, but lossless. FLAC stands out as the fastest and most widely supported lossless audio codec, and the only one that at once is non-proprietary, is unencumbered by patents, has an open-source reference implementation, has a well documented format and API, and has several other independent implementations.
